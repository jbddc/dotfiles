# 👨‍💻 this lad's .dotfiles

The idea of this repo is for me to be able to spin up a new computer with my personal environment by just feeding it my personal info. (not the case atm unfortunately though)

I use nix-home to keep my macOS config files tidy.

I also use nix to configure my home server.

Windows is used for my gaming machine, so only a few barebone configs setup for emergencies 🚨

## dependencies

- git
- git-crypt
- nix
- brew (mac)
- chocolatey (windows)

## up and running

```make help``` for now. Will update later
